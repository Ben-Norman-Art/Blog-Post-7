<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">As the game "Job Job" started I was able to be one of the players participating. The mechanic was confusing at first but as the first round was played it I was able to understand it more. There seemed to be a small sense of narrative within playing, not just this game but most of the Jackbox game. The narrative with this game being the players acting as a person going into an interview. After submitting the answer to the first question the game provides the game then provides random words that other players have used as well as some random words that the game gives. The aspect that the players need to use their creative prowess to use random words to come up with answers creates a fun and somewhat challenging system within the game.

The second game that was played, I participated as an audience member. The audience was able to have a much more stable understanding of fellowship, which consisted of democratic voting. The players have to try to win as much hearts by the end of the last night in the game and whoever had the most hearts would win. The audience is able to participate and even have the possibility of winning. We played as a zombie and if we match with someone they also become a zombie and if all players are zombies by the end of the last night the audience wins. The aspect of the audience having to work together in order to win the game makes the audience have a sense of involvement.
